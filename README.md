## United States Districts

This is a temporary fork of `unitedstates/districts` with updated shapes for the 118th Congress. I intend on merging these shapes back to the main repo when I can condense the sources back to the census rather than the various places I sourced them from so that I had them in place for the beginning of the Congressional session.

The only other addition is the validation / reformatting tool in the `*.go` files.
